Asides from unit testing we make use of [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/) and [httParrot](https://github.com/danielmarreirosdeoliveira/httParrot) and Jasmine to perform some basic e2e testing.

## Auto-Test Runner

At the root of the repo there is a little bash script which sets up the necessary
environment for the e2e tests and then runs first the unit tests and second the e2e tests.

```bash
test/e2e/test.sh
```

The script first runs the unit test suite. If it passes, it
sets up the environment for e2e testing. This is done by setting up the necessary background processes for the
webdriver-manager, httParrot, and "grunt uitest", which will set up the necessary environment to run the protractor test suite against the application code.

After a run of the script, the background processes remain as daemonized processes.
To kill them, run

```bash
test/e2e/test.sh kill
```

## Manual Setup

To set up the UI testing toolstack, you need to perform the following steps, each one in its own terminal tab:

1\. Run the Selenium server, which will handle the requests to the browser (currently Chrome) 

```bash
webdriver-manager start
```

It will run on port 4444.

2\. Run the httParrot server, which will mock the backend and will be configured from within the tests

```bash
cd lib/httParrot
node httParrot.js
```

It will run on port 1236.

3\. Run the (AngularJS) application under test itself by calling

```bash
grunt server
````

It will run on port 1234.

4\. Run the tests with

```bash
protractor config/protractor.conf.js
```

which will invoke all tests matching the filename pattern test/e2e/*Spec.js.
