Asides from unit testing we make use of [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/#/) and [httParrot](https://github.com/danielmarreirosdeoliveira/httParrot) and Jasmine to perform some basic UI testing.

## Preparative works

For the UI tests to work properly, edit your [js/app.js](js/app.js). Change 

```javascript
dataserviceUri: "http://" + document.location.host + "/data",
```

to 

```javascript
dataserviceUri: "http://localhost:1236/data",
```

This is to let the frontend speak to a fake backend.

**Don't** forget to change that back later!


## Auto-Test Runner

At the root of the repo there is a little bash script which sets up the necessary
environment for the UI tests and then runs first the unit tests and second the UI tests.

```bash
uitest.sh
```

The script first runs the unit test suite. If it passes, it
sets up the environment for UI testing. This is done by setting up the necessary background processes for

```bash
webdriver-manager start
node lib/httParrot/httParrot.js
```

Finally a call to

```
grunt uitest
```

will set up the application server and run the protractor test suite against
the application code.

After a run of the script, the background processes remain as daemonized processes.
To kill them, run

```bash
./uitest.sh kill
```

## Manual Setup

To set up the UI testing toolstack, you need to perform the following steps, each one in its own terminal tab:

1\. Run the Selenium server, which will handle the requests to the browser (currently Chrome) 

```bash
webdriver-manager start
```

It will run on port 4444.

2\. Run the httParrot server, which will mock the backend and will be configured from within the tests

```bash
cd lib/httParrot
node httParrot.js
```

It will run on port 1236.

3\. Run the (AngularJS) application under test itself by calling

```bash
grunt server
````

It will run on port 1234.

4\. Run the tests with

```bash
protractor config/protractor.conf.js
```

which will invoke all tests matching the filename pattern specUI/*Spec.js.
