        <p class="c1">To order pictures as publication models, refer to the original models for the pictures desired:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Scans from books (images with negative number "Repro") or copies from other picture archives or museums
                (images with negative number "ohne Angabe" or "Museum") can neither be ordered over the online ordering
                system nor by contact form. These images have to be requested from the individual owners.</li>

                            scientific purposes. In all other cases the prices for the right to publish the image
